# 🏠 Home Server Deployment

This repository holds my docker compose files and configuration files for services I host on my homelab. For a while I have been experimenting with different recipies and services to see what works. Whilst this is a public repository, my needs may not be the same as yours, but feel free to fork this and tweak it as you desire.

## Containers

{containers}

## Prerequisites

A linux-based operating system with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

## Installation

**Clone the Github repository**
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ben-pearce/jessie-server-deployment && cd jessie-server-deployment
```

**Copy both example.config and example.env**
```
cp -rp example.config .config && cp -rp example.env .env
```

**Edit .env and [other config files](https://github.com/ben-pearce/jessie-server-deployment/tree/main/example.config) as desired**
```
vi .env
```

> **⚠️ If migrating data, copy the .data directory from previous installation now.**

**Bring up the container network**
```
docker-compose up -d
```
> 💭 The `aggregate-docker-compose.sh` script can be treated exactly like `docker-compose` command. 

## Configuration
The `.env` file stores environment variables to make starting the containers easy. This should be modified to match your needs before starting the containers for the first time.

First of all, **thanks for your interest!** But due to this being a personal project of mine tailored to my own needs, I cannot accept pull requests on this repository. Please feel free to fork and tweak this project though, and if you wish you can also open an issue to make suggestions for improvement and showcase your own homelab setups based off of this repo!
